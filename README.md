# Bus-Mall
## I built a website called Bus-Mall . Generates random combination of pictures to choose from. Then it displays the total views and clicks each picture has and saves that data to local storage, persisting the data.It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

# Reflections and Comments
- The hardest part of this was probably setting up the randomization for the pictures and making sure that no two rounds will ever be the same. 
- used a wireframe fot the css portion but made sure to keep it bare bones.
